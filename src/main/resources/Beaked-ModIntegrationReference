Here is where we highlight any features in Beaked that are intended to interact with other mods, or that other mods can easily configure.

 - NO_CRAZY_RITUALS Tag:
Beaked has a card named Crazy Rituals that plays random cards of ANY color, including other mods' cards.
Currently it excludes special rarity cards, curses, statuses, and unplayable cards automatically.
If you have a card that you do NOT want Crazy Rituals to use, give it the BeakedCardTags.NO_CRAZY_RITUALS tag.

 - NO_SACRED_DECK Tag:
Beaked has a super-rare boss relic called Sacred Deck that allows you to add ANY one card in the game to your deck.
No cards are currently excluded, so you can even choose cards of special rarity and ones you couldn't normally obtain.
This relic is in the spirit of fun rather than balance, and there are tons of overpowered cards available to pick, so don't worry much about keeping things fair.
If you have a card that should NOT appear in Sacred Deck's selection (as in, obtaining it would literally cause the game to break), give it the BeakedCardTags.NO_SACRED_DECK tag.
